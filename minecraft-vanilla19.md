## Compatibility Notes
For this server we have enabled Bedrock client compatibility using [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) to allow those using "Bedrock Edition" (avilable on Windows 10, iOS, Android, and console) to play along with the Java Edition players on our server. Due to differences in compatibility there may be some additional features (eg custom potions, enchants, and items) that are not available or do not appear correctly to Bedrock users.

## Connecting from your Gaming Console
On console you may be able to connect to the bedrock edition port by doing some DNS shenanigans. Check out these videos (provided by others) for information for your specific platform:
